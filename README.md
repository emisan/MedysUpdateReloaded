# MedysUpdateReloaded
Upload-Routine for downloading update files

This project was formerly for downloading updates from a dedicated server (medys FTP).

With a little modification it can be used for any downloading-routine to receive files from a certain folder from a ftp-server or 
another URI.

<b>This project needs following JAR-libraries in a new projects build path</b>:
<ul>
 <li>the "jfxrt.jar" (can be retrieved from the installed JDK/JRE) in the &lt;JAVA Installation-Directory&gt;/lib-folder when you run JAVA < 1.8</li>
 <li>Apache Commons Net 3.1 from here: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-net/commons-net/3.1 (or newer, but then with possbile project-fix-issues)</li>
 <li>a JAR build from the project : https://github.com/emisan/MedysFileTools
</ul>
